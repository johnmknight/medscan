// --- MedScan Mod ---
// 
//  This mod is designed to reflect on a number of real world medical experiments that
//  are helping astronauts to live longer and healthier in space and on Earth.
//
//  Some of the ideas behind the individual experiments came from Natacha Chough, an Aerospace medical resident and ER doctor. THANK YOU!
